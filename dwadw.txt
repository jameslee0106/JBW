What is abstraction?
-- Object Oriented Programming (OOP) => Polymorphism, Inheritance, Interfaces

What is the goal of abstraction:
- organize objects (clearly identify what each object has/does)
- Loosely couple complex code / object


Tightly Coupled Objects vs Loosely Coupled Objects:
- More flexibility for loosely coupled objects.
- When there are more loose parts, it's **easier to test** each individual part.
- Less resources if the problem is small

Goal:
- Build a mental model: Abstract, Componentizing, Refactoring
-
